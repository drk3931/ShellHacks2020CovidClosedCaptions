This application lets you choose audio sources and stream the audio to google cloud for live speech to text and translation purposes.
It works by capturing a desktop window in a GUI and streaming the audio of it to a NodeJS server process. It initially accomplishes text to speech but other APIs can be layered on top such as the translation function and other google APIs.
